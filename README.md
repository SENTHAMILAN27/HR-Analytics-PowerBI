# 🧠 HR Analytics Dashboard – Power BI Project

This project analyzes employee attendance behavior, leave trends, WFH patterns, and sick leave spikes using interactive Power BI visuals. Designed to assist HR teams in monitoring workforce presence and improving operational planning.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Monitor daily and monthly attendance across employees
- Identify patterns in WFH, SL (Sick Leave), and overall presence
- Compare KPIs across departments, individuals, and weekdays
- Deliver actionable insights to HR using dynamic dashboards

---

## 📊 Tools & Skills Used

- **Power BI** – Data modeling, DAX, custom KPI visuals, slicers
- **DAX** – Time intelligence (MoM change, trend logic, arrow icons)
- **Excel** – Data prep and transformation
- **Data Viz** – Trend lines, KPI cards, day-wise comparison tables

---

## 📈 Key Insights (with Possible Explanations)

- 🔹 **Attendance % dropped from 94% to 89.7%** → May saw a 4.5% decline, possibly due to mid-quarter fatigue, public holidays, or increased WFH preference.
  
- 🔹 **WFH % rose by 23.4%**, peaking at **16.4% on Fridays** → Suggests employees prefer remote work before weekends, likely due to **extended personal time or travel** plans.
  
- 🔹 **Sick Leave (SL%) surged by 276%** → May show seasonal health issues (e.g., flu/cold) or burnout in high-pressure teams. Mid-month SL spikes also signal stress buildup.

- 🔹 **Leave % increased by 70.6%**, especially on **Wednesdays and Thursdays** → Could indicate mid-week breaks to balance work-life or take advantage of adjacent long weekends.

## 🔎 Business Interpretation

These patterns provide clear signals for HR:
- Align **in-office requirements** earlier in the week (Mon–Wed)
- Investigate whether leave/sick patterns are seasonal or role-specific
- Build early warning alerts for **compliance drops** or **resource gaps**
